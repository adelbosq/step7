Do you know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no
memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place
with no memory.

Dear Red, If you're reading this, you've gotten out. And if you've
come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You
remember the name of the town, don't you? [Red: PASSWORDHERE]

I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an
eye out for you and the chessboard ready. Remember, Red. Hope is a good
thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be
hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend,
Andy.
